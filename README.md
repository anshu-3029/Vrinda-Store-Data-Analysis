This project analyzes Vrinda Store’s sales data using Microsoft Excel and also by using Tableau to gain business insights.
An interactive dashboard was created to visualize monthly sales, top-performing states, customer demographics, and delivery performance.
Key findings show that March had the highest sales, 64% of customers were women, and most orders came from Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra.
The analysis helps in identifying profitable regions and improving marketing strategies.
